* Description
This is the emacs configuration i've been using and updating since i started using emacs. Before that, my main editor was vim and i configurated emacs to work
with the workflow i was used to.

Evil-mode and leader-mode are a must for me and all this configuration is constructed around this modes.

For now i've been focusing in python development and org mode, but soon i will give a good support for java,C,PHP,Javascript and HTML as well.
* Installation
** Dependencies
Emacs 23 or greater (Emacs 24 is required for some functionality).
** Setup
Just clone the repo in your $HOME:
#+BEGIN_SRC 
git clone https://github.com/rayenok/.emacs.d.git
#+END_SRC
Keep in mind that there are some variables useless for you and some modes unused.
* Usage
